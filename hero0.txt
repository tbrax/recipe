The Order of the Oyo's solution to all problems - another round!

Drunken Brawler
Drunken Brawler
Gives a chance to avoid attacks and to deal critical damage. Drunken Brawler will always trigger if you have not attacked, or have not been attacked, in the last several seconds.
Evasion:
10%/15%/20%/25% (Talent 25%/30%/35%/40%)
Critical Chance:
10%/15%/20%/25% (Talent 25%/30%/35%/40%)
Critical Damage:
230%
Certain Trigger Timer:
13/12/11/10
Can be used by illusions. Illusions also have the guaranteed crit and evasion. Red critical numbers are before illusion and armor reduction.
When Mangix won his title as the Brewmaster of the Order of Oyo, he also claimed his place in the mastery of inebriation.
Increases attack damage by an average of 13%/19.5%/26%/32.5% (Talent 32.5%/39%/45.5%/52%) and survivability versus attacks by 11%/18%/25%/33% (Talent 33%/43%/54%/67%), excluding the guaranteed crit/dodge.
The proc chances of multiple crit sources stack.
If two sources of critical strike proc at the same time, the higher multiplier has priority.
Drunken Brawler's evasion stacks multiplicatively with other sources of evasion.
Drunken Brawler's crit and evasion use pseudo-random distribution.
The guaranteed critical strike and guaranteed dodge chance use separate trigger timers, not actual ability cooldowns.
This means that using Refresher Orb does not refresh them.
This also means they are not affected by the Cooldown Reduction of Octarine Core and Arcane Rune.
While either of them is not ready, Brewmaster can still passively evade attacks and perform critical strikes.
When the guaranteed critical strike is ready, Brewmaster's upper body emits particles, while a red streak is visible on the icon.
When the guaranteed dodge is ready, Brewmaster's lower body emits particles, while the icon's yellow background turns orange.
When both the guaranteed critical strike and dodge are ready, both of these visual indicators are visible and shown on the icon.
The guaranteed critical strike is only used up if the attack actually lands. Missed attacks do not reset its certain trigger timer.
The guaranteed evasion is only used up if an attack actually misses. Attacks with True Strike do not reset its certain trigger timer.
The sound and particles of the critical strike play upon start of the attack, not when the attack lands.

Primal Split	COST: 125/150/175 MANA Cooldown: 140/120/100 (Talent 75/55/35)

Cast Animation:
0.65+0
Split Time:
0.6
Duration:
16/18/20

Upgradable by Aghanim's Scepter. Earth gains Thunder Clap, Storm gains Drunken Haze and Fire gains Drunken Brawler.
It isn't clear whether Mangix is consciously aware of his potent bond with nature, as it often occurs in the midst of a drunken stupor.
Brewmaster is invulnerable and hidden during the split time and duration. Does not apply any form of dispel upon cast.
During Primal Split, Brewmaster is periodically moved to Earth's position. If Earth dies, to Storm's and if Storm dies, to Fire's. This affects multiple things such as:
When Primal Split ends, Brewmaster appears at Earth's location. If Earth is dead, at Storm's and if Storm is dead, at Fire's location.
Every aura Brewmaster has (including Gem of True Sight and Radiance) affects units around Earth, if Earth is dead, around Storm and if Storm is dead, around Fire.
Effects which react on heroes' presence (Smoke of Deceit, Marksmanship, Blur) react on Earth's presence, if Earth is dead, on Storm's and if Storm is dead, on Fire's.
Teleporting effects like Holy Persuasion or Relocate cause the periodic moving of Brewmaster to get canceled, so that the 3 notes above do not apply anymore.
The spirits spawn always in the same formation, forming an equilateral triangle which fits within a 100 radius circle.
The earth spirit is always spawned 100 range in front on Brewmaster's cast location.
The storm spirit is always spawned 50 range behind and 86.603 range to the left of Brewmaster's cast location.
The fire spirit is always spawned 50 range behind and 86.603 range to the right of Brewmaster's cast location.
Their facing angle equals Brewmaster's facing angle on cast.
The spirits are creep-heroes and ancient creeps, making them interact differently with several spells. For detailed interactions follow the two links.

Damage:
100/160/220

The bonus damage is directly added to the attack damage, so it can be reduced with e.g. Enfeeble or Static Link.
However, it cannot be amplified with e.g. Empower.
The damage is considered by lifesteal, splash and crits.
During the fade time, Storm can cast spells and perform attacks without breaking the invisibility.
Those attacks do apply the 100/160/220 damage to the target.
The bonus damage is not applied when attacking buildings out of the invisibility, but is applied against wards.
The invisibility is lost upon reaching the cast point of spells, or upon launching an attack.
This means when the attack misses, the invisibility is still lost.
Allows Storm to pass through other units, including wards, but not through buildings.
