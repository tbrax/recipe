MIST WALKER
 
Abilities
Endless March
The Mist Walker remains near its master until they enter combat in a lane, whereupon it proceeds along the lane and attacks any enemy in its path.

Decay
The Mist Walker will only deal 40% damage if it moves too far away from Yorick.

Single targeted spells and attacks will instantly kill the Mist Walker.

Ravenous
While in a 1400-radius of Mourning Mist's mark, the Mist Walker benefits from Mourning Mist's bonus movement speed, and has the ability to dash to marked enemy champions, indicated by an exclamation mark over its head.

While the Mist Walker is near Yorick, it gains 60 movement speed and benefits from Yorick's flat movement speed bonuses. Stormraider's Surge is an percentual exception.

Unholy Covenant
Unlike other pets, the Mist Walker is not prioritized by turrets over Siege Minions, though they are prioritized over the Maiden of the Mist.

Mist Walkers are considered to be a source of Yorick's physical damage, and will trigger effects such as Corrupting Potion's Touch of Corruption and The Black Cleaver, as well as heal Yorick if he has a Death's Dance or a Hextech Gunblade.

They will not trigger Yorick's on-hit effects, including life steal. Yorick's champion summoned units have been special-cased to not trigger Rylai's Crystal Scepter's slow.

Undead Army
Upon spawning, the Maiden of the Mist summons 2 / 3 / 4 Mist Walkers by her side, and while she has fewer than 4 under her fold, she raises another Mist Walker every time a nearby enemy dies.

Ravenous
The Maiden of the Mist benefits from Mourning Mist's bonus movement speed, and actively seeks to assist Yorick if he is nearby and in combat with an enemy champion.

While the Maiden of the Mist is near Yorick, she gains 60 movement speed and benefits from Yorick's flat movement speed bonuses. Stormraider's Surge is a percentual exception.

Unholy Covenant
Unlike other pets, the Maiden of the Mist is not prioritized by turrets over Siege Minions.

She is considered to be a source of Yorick's magic damage, and will trigger effects such as Corrupting Potion's Touch of Corruption, Morellonomicon and Hextech Gunblade's healing.

MAGIC DAMAGE:
150 / 250 / 350 (+ 70% AP)

Bloblet
Bloblets can be targeted by Smite, Consume, and/or Force of Will.
A Force of Will grabbed Bloblet, while visually separated from the others, will not delay Zac's revival or cause him to recombine with less current health.
Bloblet can be targeted by Teleport, becoming invulnerable for the channel's duration.
Taste Their Fear considers Bloblet 'isolated' when being the last one alive or after having merged with the others right before Zac recombines (Bloblet is not considered 'isolated' when close enough to the others)
